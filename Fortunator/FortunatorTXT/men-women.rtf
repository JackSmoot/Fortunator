you get a divorce so I can marry her.\'a0 If you win, I promise never to see\

terrible problem, Doctor.\'a0 I have a son at Harvard and another son at\
Princeton; I've just gifted each of them with a new Ferrari; I've got\
homes in Beverly Hills, Palm Beach, and a co-op in New York; and I've\
got a thriving ranch in Venezuela.\'a0 My wife is a gorgeous young actress\
who considers my two mistresses to be her best friends."\

something?\'a0 It sounds to me like you have no problems at all."\

A man took his wife deer hunting for the first time.\'a0 After he'd given her\
some basic instructions, they agreed to separate and rendezvous later.\'a0 Before\
he left, he warned her if she should fell a deer to be wary of hunters who\
might beat her to the carcass and claim the kill.\'a0 If that happened, he told\
her, she should fire her gun three times into the air and he would come to\
her aid.\
\'a0\'a0\'a0 Shortly after they separated, he heard a single shot, followed quickly\
by the agreed upon signal.\'a0 Running to the scene, he found his wife standing\
in a small clearing with a very nervous man staring down her gun barrel.\
\'a0\'a0\'a0 "He claims this is his," she said, obviously very upset.\
\'a0\'a0\'a0 "She can keep it, she can keep it!" the wide-eyed man replied.\'a0 "I\
just want to get my saddle back!"\

A man was griping to his friend about how he hated to go home after a\
late card games.\
\'a0\'a0\'a0 "You wouldn't believe what I go through to avoid waking my wife,"\
he said.\'a0 "First, I kill the engine a block away from the house and coast\
into the garage.\'a0 Then I open the door slowly, take off my shoes, and\
tiptoe to our room.\'a0 But just as I'm about to slide into bed, she always\
wakes up and gives me hell."\
\'a0\'a0\'a0 "I make a big racket when I go home," his friend replied.\
\'a0\'a0\'a0 "You do?"\
\'a0\'a0\'a0 "Sure.\'a0 I honk the horn, slam the door, turn on all the lights,\
stomp up to the bedroom and give my wife a big kiss.\'a0 `Hi, Alice,' I say.\
`How about a little smooch for your old man?'"\
\'a0\'a0\'a0 "And what does she say?" his friend asked in disbelief.\
\'a0\'a0\'a0 "She doesn't say anything," his buddy replied.\'a0 "She always pretends\
she's asleep."\

A man was kneeling by a grave in a cemetery, crying and praying very loudly,\

\'a0\'a0\'a0 "Excuse me, sir, but I've been seeing you for hours now,\
carrying on at this grave.\'a0 You must have been very close to the deceased."\
\'a0\'a0\'a0 "No, I never met him.\'a0 Oh why....eeeee did you dieeeeee,\
why....eeeee did you.."\
\'a0\'a0\'a0 "Sir, you say you never met this person, yet you carry on so?\
Tell, me who is buried here?"\
\'a0\'a0\'a0 "My wife's first husband."\

A man was talking to his best friend about his married life.\'a0 "You know," he\
says, "I really trust my wife, and I think she has always been faithful to\
me, but there's *always* that doubt.\'a0 There's *always* that little doubt."\
\'a0\'a0\'a0 "Yeah, I know what you mean," his friend replies.\
\'a0\'a0\'a0 "Well, buddy, I've got to leave on a business trip this weekend,\
and I wonder... well... would you watch my house while I'm gone?\'a0 I trust\
her, it's just that there's *always* that doubt."\
\'a0\'a0\'a0 The friend agreed to help out and two weeks later gave his report.\
\'a0\'a0\'a0 "I've got some bad news for you," says the friend.\'a0 "The evening\
after you left I saw a strange car pull up in front of your house.\'a0 A man\
got out of the car and went in the house and had dinner with your wife.\
After dinner they went upstairs and I saw your wife kissing him.\'a0 Then, he\
took off his shirt and she took off her blouse.\'a0 And then the light went\
out."\
\'a0\'a0\'a0 "*Then* what happened?" said the husband, his eyes opening wide.\
\'a0\'a0\'a0 "Well, I don't know," replied the friend, "it was too dark to see."\
\'a0\'a0\'a0 "Damn!" roared the husband.\'a0 "You see what I mean?\'a0 There's *always*\
that doubt!"\

A psychiatrist is a fellow who asks you a lot of expensive questions\
your wife asks you for nothing.\

\'a0\'a0\'a0 A pushy romeo asked a gorgeous elevator operator, "Don't all these\

\'a0\'a0\'a0 A Scotsman was strolling across High Street one day wearing his kilt.\
As he neared the far curb, he noticed two young blondes in a red convertible\
eyeing him and giggling.\'a0 One of them called out, "Hey, Scotty!\'a0 What's worn\
under the kilt?"\
\'a0\'a0\'a0 He strolled over to the side of the car and asked, "Ach, lass, are you\
SURE you want to know?"\'a0 Somewhat nervously, the blonde replied yes, she did\
really want to know.\
\'a0\'a0\'a0 The Scotsman leaned closer and confided, "Why, lass, nothing's worn\
under the kilt, everything's in perfect workin' order!"\
%\
A sharper perspective on this matter is particularly important to feminist\
thought today, because a major tendency in feminism has constructed the\
problem of domination as a drama of female vulnerability victimized by male\
aggression.\'a0 Even the more sophisticated feminist thinkers frequently shy\
away from the analysis of submission, for fear that in admitting woman's\
participation in the relationship of domination, the onus of responsibility\
will appear to shift from men to women, and the moral victory from women to\
men.\'a0 More generally, this has been a weakness of radical politics: to\
idealize the oppressed, as if their politics and culture were untouched by\
the system of domination, as if people did not participate in their own\
submission.\'a0 To reduce domination to a simple relation of doer and done-to\
is to substitute moral outrage for analysis.\
\'a0\'a0\'a0 \'a0\'a0\'a0 -- Jessica Benjamin, "The Bonds of Love"\
%\
A sociologist, a psychologist, and a engineer were discussing the\
consequences and implications of a married man's having a mistress.\'a0 The\
sociologist's opinion was that it is absolutely and categorically unforgivable\
for a married man to forfeit the bond of matrimony, and engage in such lowly\
and lustful pursuits.\
\'a0\'a0\'a0 The psychologist's opinion was that although morally reprehensible,\
if a man MUST have a mistress to achieve his full potential as a human being,\
then -- well -- he may go ahead and choose to have a mistress, as long as he\
is considerate enough to keep this secret from his wife.\
\'a0\'a0\'a0 The engineer then interjected: "I also believe that, if necessary,\
a married man is entitled to a mistress.\'a0 However, I do not see why the\
affair should be concealed from the wife.\'a0 On the contrary, if the affair\
is out in the open, then on Friday evenings he may tell his wife that he\
is going to see his mistress, tell his mistress that he is going to be with\
his wife, then go to his office and get some work done!"\

A wife lasts only for the length of the marriage, but an ex-wife is there\

A woman did what a woman had to, the best way she knew how.\

%\
A woman may very well form a friendship with a man, but for this to endure,\
it must be assisted by a little physical antipathy.\
\'a0\'a0\'a0 \'a0\'a0\'a0 -- Nietzsche\

A woman of generous character will sacrifice her life a thousand times\
over for her lover, but will break with him for ever over a question of\
pride -- for the opening or the shutting of a door.\

A woman's place is in the house... and in the Senate.\

A young man and his girlfriend were walking along Main Street when she spotted\
a beautiful diamond ring in a jewelry-store window.\'a0 "Wow, I'd sure love to\
have that!" she gushed.\
\'a0\'a0\'a0 "No problem," her companion replied, throwing a brick through the\
window and grabbing the ring.\
\'a0\'a0\'a0 A few blocks later, the woman admired a full-length sable coat.\'a0 "What\
I'd give to own that," she said, sighing.\
\'a0\'a0\'a0 "No problem," he said, throwing a brick through the window and grabbing\
the coat.\
\'a0\'a0\'a0 Finally, turning for home, they passed a car dealership.\'a0 "Boy, I'd do\
anything for one of those Rolls-Royces," she said.\
\'a0\'a0\'a0 "Jeez, baby," the guy moaned, "you think I'm made of bricks?"\

A young man enters the New York branch of Tiffany's on a Friday evening and\
walks up to a display case full of pearl necklaces.\'a0 He turns to a gorgeous\
woman, who is obviously windowshopping, looks her straight in the eye and\
says, "I can tell by your eyes that you really want that necklace.\'a0 If you'll\
allow me, I'd like to buy it for you."\
\'a0\'a0\'a0 The woman looks him up and down; he's wearing a nice suit and some\
pretty nice jewelry, but she has trouble believing this story.\
\'a0\'a0\'a0 "Look, this is some kind of put on, right?"\
\'a0\'a0\'a0 "No, really.\'a0 You see, I've got quite a lot of money -- so much that\
I could never spend it all.\'a0 I'd really like for you to have it."\
\'a0\'a0\'a0 The guys whips out his checkbook, writes a check for five figures,\
calls over a clerk and hands it to him.\'a0 The clerk peers at the check, looks\
at the young man, looks at the check again.\'a0 "Very good, sir.\'a0 I'm afraid I\
can't release the necklace immediately, would Monday be all right?"\
\'a0\'a0\'a0 "That'll be fine, she'll pick it up." the man replies, and walks out\
of the store with the woman following him in a daze.\
\'a0\'a0\'a0 The next Monday the man comes back in and walks up to the counter.\
The same clerk hurries over to him and says, "Sir, I'm sorry to have to tell\
you this, but your check was returned for insufficient funds."\

terrific weekend."\

American culture is based on the automobile, and any young man of promise\
is going to own one and want to travel great distances in it.\'a0 Consequently,\
any young woman of aspiration should expect to spend most of her vacations\
in a car, probing into unfamiliar corners.\'a0 She is not required to know how\
to drive but she will certainly be expected to read the road map while her\
husband drives, and if she can't, or if she's abnormally slow in giving him\
help, she's bound to cause trouble.\'a0 Therefore, you'd think that colleges\
which train the bright young women who're going to marry the bright young\
men who are going to own the Cadillacs that roar back and forth across this\
continent would teach the girls to read maps.\'a0 None do. They teach a hundred\
other useless things, but never a word about the one that will cause the\
greatest friction.\

%\
And yet I should have dearly liked, I own, to have touched her lips; to\
have questioned her, that she might have opened them; to have looked upon\
the lashes of her downcast eyes, and never raised a blush; to have let\
loose waves of hair, an inch of which would be a keepsake beyond price:\
in short, I should have liked, I do confess, to have had the lightest\
license of a child, and yet been man enough to know its value.\

%\
Another greeting card category consists of those persons who send out\
photographs of their families every year.\'a0 In the same mail that brought the\
greetings from Marcia and Philip, my friend found such a conversation piece.\
"My God, Lida is enormous!" she exclaimed.\'a0 I don't know why women want to\
record each year, for two or three hundred people to see, the ravages wrought\
upon them, their mates, and their progeny by the artillery of time, but\
between five and seven per cent of Christmas cards, at a rough estimate, are\
family groups, and even the most charitable recipient studies them for little\
signs of dissolution or derangement.\'a0 Nothing cheers a woman more, I am afraid,\
than the proof that another woman is letting herself go, or has lost control\
of her figure, or is clearly driving her husband crazy, or is obviously\
drinking more than is good for her, or still doesn't know what to wear.\
Middle-aged husbands in such photographs are often described as looking\
"young enough to be her son," but they don't always escape so easily, and a\
couple opening envelopes in the season of mercy and good will sometimes handle\
a male friend or acquaintance rather sharply.\'a0 "Good Lord!" the wife will say.\
"Frank looks like a sex-crazed shotgun slayer, doesn't he?"\'a0 "Not to me," the\
husband may reply.\'a0 "to me he looks more like a Wilkes-Barre dentist who is\
being sought by the police in connection with the disappearance of a choir\
singer."\

Asked how she felt being the first woman to make a major-league team, she\
said, "Like a pig in mud," or words to that effect, and then turned and\
released a squirt of tobacco juice from the wad of rum soaked plug in her\
right cheek.\'a0 She chewed a rare brand of plug called Stuff It, which she\
learned to chew when she was playing Nicaraguan summer ball.\'a0 She told the\
writers, "They were so mean to me down there you couldn't write it in your\
newspaper.\'a0 I took a gun everywhere I went, even to bed.\'a0 *Especially* to\
bed.\'a0 Guys were after me like you can't believe.\'a0 That's when I started\
chewing tobacco -- because no matter how bad anybody treats you, it's not\
as bad as this.\'a0 This is the worst chew in the world.\'a0 After this,\
everything else is peaches and cream."\'a0 The writers elected Gentleman Jim,\
the Sparrow's P.R. guy, to bite off a chunk and tell them how it tasted,\

together, I lay there on our bed recovering from a slight illness.\'a0 My\
wife was sitting on a chair next to the bed, humming softly and watching\
the late afternoon sun filtering through the trees.\'a0 The only sounds to\
be heard elsewhere were the clock ticking, the kettle downstairs starting\
to boil, and an occasional schoolchild passing beneath our window.\'a0 And\
as I looked up into my wife's now wrinkled face, but still warm and\
twinkling eyes, I realized something about perfection...\'a0 It comes only\
with time.\

It did not occur to me that my being with two men continuously would\

\'a0\'a0\'a0 It is always preferable to visit home with a friend.\'a0 Your parents will\
not be pleased with this plan, because they want you all to themselves and\
because in the presence of your friend, they will have to act like mature\
human beings.\
\'a0\'a0\'a0 The worst kind of friend to take home is a girl, because in that case,\
there is the potential that your parents will lose you not just for the\
duration of the visit but forever.\'a0 The worst kind of girl to take home is one\
of a different religion:\'a0 Not only will you be lost to your parents forever but\
you will be lost to a woman who is immune to their religious/moral arguments\
and whose example will irretrievably corrupt you.\
\'a0\'a0\'a0 Let's say you've fallen in love with just such a girl and would like\
to take her home for the holidays.\'a0 You are aware of your parents' xenophobic\
response to anyone of a different religion.\'a0 How to prepare them for the shock?\
\'a0\'a0\'a0 Simple.\'a0 Call them up shortly before your visit and tell them that you\
have gotten quite serious about somebody who is of a different religion, a\
different race and the same sex.\'a0 Tell them you have already invited this\
person to meet them.\'a0 Give the information a moment to sink in and then\
remark that you were only kidding, that your lover is merely of a different\
religion.\'a0 They will be so relieved they will welcome her with open arms.\

\'a0\'a0\'a0 Once upon a time there was a beautiful young girl taking a stroll\
through the woods.\'a0 All at once she saw an extremely ugly bull frog seated\
on a log and to her amazement the frog spoke to her.\'a0 "Maiden," croaked the\
frog, "would you do me a favor?\'a0 This will be hard for you to believe, but\
I was once a handsome, charming prince and then a mean, ugly old witch cast\
a spell over me and turned me into a frog."\
\'a0\'a0\'a0 "Oh, what a pity!", exclaimed the girl.\'a0 "I'll do anything I can to\
help you break such a spell."\
\'a0\'a0\'a0 "Well," replied the frog, "the only way that this spell can be\
taken away is for some lovely young woman to take me home and let me spend\
the night under her pillow."\
\'a0\'a0\'a0 The young girl took the ugly frog home and placed him beneath her\
pillow that night when she retired.\'a0 When she awoke the next morning, sure\
enough, there beside her in bed was a very young, handsome man, clearly of\
royal blood.\'a0 And so they lived happily ever after, except that to this day\
her father and mother still don't believe her story.\
%\
\'a0\'a0\'a0 Once upon a time there were three brothers who were knights\
in a certain kingdom.\'a0 And, there was a Princess in a neighboring kingdom\
who was of marriageable age.\'a0 Well, one day, in full armour, their horses,\
and their page, the three brothers set off to see if one of them could\
win her hand.\'a0 The road was long and there were many obstacles along the\
way, robbers to be overcome, hard terrain to cross.\'a0 As they coped with\
each obstacle they became more and more disgusted with their page.\'a0 He was\
not only inept, he was a coward, he could not handle the horses, he was,\
in short, a complete flop.\'a0 When they arrived at the court of the kingdom,\
they found that they were expected to present the Princess with some\
treasure.\'a0 The two older brothers were discouraged, since they had not\
thought of this and were unprepared.\'a0 The youngest, however, had the\
answer:\'a0 Promise her anything, but give her our page.\
%\
\'a0\'a0\'a0 One evening he spoke.\'a0 Sitting at her feet, his face raised to her,\
he allowed his soul to be heard.\'a0 "My darling, anything you wish, anything\
I am, anything I can ever be...\'a0 That's what I want to offer you -- not the\
things I'll get for you, but the thing in me that will make me able to get\
them.\'a0 That thing -- a man can't renounce it -- but I want to renounce it -- so\
that it will be yours -- so that it will be in your service -- only for you."\
\'a0\'a0\'a0 The girl smiled and asked: "Do you think I'm prettier than Maggie\
Kelly?"\
\'a0\'a0\'a0 He got up.\'a0 He said nothing and walked out of the house.\'a0 He never\
saw that girl again.\'a0 Gail Wynand, who prided himself on never needing a\

Only two groups of people fall for flattery -- men and women.\

\'a0\'a0\'a0 People of all sorts of genders are reporting great difficulty,\
these days, in selecting the proper words to refer to those of the female\
persuasion.\
\'a0\'a0\'a0 "Lady," "woman," and "girl" are all perfectly good words, but\
misapplying them can earn one anything from the charge of vulgarity to a good\
swift smack.\'a0 We are messing here with matters of deference, condescension,\
respect, bigotry, and two vague concepts, age and rank.\'a0 It is troubling\
enough to get straight who is really what.\'a0 Those who deliberately misuse\
the terms in a misbegotten attempt at flattery are asking for it.\
\'a0\'a0\'a0 A woman is any grown-up female person.\'a0 A girl is the un-grown-up\
version.\'a0 If you call a wee thing with chubby cheeks and pink hair ribbons a\
"woman," you will probably not get into trouble, and if you do, you will be\
able to handle it because she will be under three feet tall.\'a0 However, if you\
call a grown-up by a child's name for the sake of implying that she has a\
youthful body, you are also implying that she has a brain to match.\

Very few modern women either like or desire marriage, especially after the\

Matrimony is something they accept when there is no alternative.\'a0 Really,\

others made me want to let people know who I was and what I believed in.\

\'a0\'a0\'a0 It is not the extraordinary exercise which harms the dancer, but\
rather the coming into close contact with the opposite sex.\'a0 It is the\

beyond doubt that passionate excessive dancing girls can hardly reach\
