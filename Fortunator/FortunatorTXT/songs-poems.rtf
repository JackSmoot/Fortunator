Abou Ben Adhem (may his tribe increase!)\
Awoke one night from a deep dream of peace,\
And saw, within the moonlight in his room,\
Making it rich, and like a lily in bloom,\
An angel writing in a book of gold.\
Exceeding peace had made Ben Adhem bold,\
And to the presence in the room he said,\
"What writest thou?"\'a0 The vision raised its head,\
And with a look made of all sweet accord,\
Answered, "The names of those who love the Lord."\
"And is mine one?" said Abou. "Nay not so,"\
Replied the angel.\'a0 Abou spoke more low,\
But cheerly still; and said, "I pray thee then,\
Write me as one that loves his fellow-men."\
The angel wrote, and vanished.\'a0 The next night\
It came again with a great wakening light,\
And showed the names whom love of God had blessed,\
And lo!\'a0 Ben Adhem's name led all the rest.\

After a while you learn the subtle difference\
Between holding a hand and chaining a soul,\
And you learn that love doesn't mean security,\
And you begin to learn that kisses aren't contracts\
And presents aren't promises\
And you begin to accept your defeats\
With your head up and your eyes open,\
With the grace of a woman, not the grief of a child,\
And you learn to build all your roads\
On today because tomorrow's ground\
Is too uncertain.\'a0 And futures have\
A way of falling down in midflight,\
After a while you learn that even sunshine burns if you get too much.\
So you plant your own garden and decorate your own soul, instead of waiting\
For someone to bring you flowers.\
And you learn that you really can endure...\
That you really are strong,\
And you really do have worth\
And you learn and learn\
With every goodbye you learn.\

Again she fled, but swift he came.\
Tin'uviel!\'a0 Tin'uviel!\
He called her by her elvish name;\
And there she halted listening.\
One moment stood she, and a spell\
His voice laid on her: Beren came\
And doom fell on Tin'uviel\
That in his arms lay glistening.\
As Beren looked into her eyes\
Within the shadows of her hair,\
The trembling starlight of the skies\
He saw there mirrored shimmering.\
Tin'uviel the elven-fair,\
Immortal maiden elven-wise,\
About him cast her shadowy hair\
And arms like silver glimmering.\
Long was the way that fate them bore,\
O'er stony mountains cold and grey,\
Through halls of iron and darkling door,\
And woods of nightshade morrowless.\
The Sundering Seas between them lay,\
And yet at last they met once more,\
And long ago they passed away\
In the forest singing sorrowless.\

Contribute to your hunting skills and natural defenses.\

A tail is quite essential for your acrobatic talents:\
You would not be so agile if you lacked its counterbalance;\
And when not being utilitized to aid in locomotion,\
It often serves to illustrate the state of your emotion.\

And though you are not sentient, Spot, and do not comprehend,\

Of feet as light as linden-leaves,\
Of music welling underground,\
In hidden hollows quavering.\
Now withered lay the hemlock-sheaves,\
And one by one with sighing sound\
Whispering fell the beechen leaves\
In the wintry woodland wavering.\
He sought her ever, wandering far\
Where leaves of years were thickly strewn,\
By light of moon and ray of star\
In frosty heavens shivering.\
Her mantle glinted in the moon,\
As on a hill-top high and far\
She danced, and at her feet was strewn\
A mist of silver quivering.\
When winter passed, she came again,\
And her song released the sudden spring,\
Like rising lark, and falling rain,\
And melting water bubbling.\

About her feet, and healed again\

In Xanadu did Kubla Khan\
A stately pleasure dome decree:\
Where Alph, the sacred river, ran\
Through caverns measureless to man\
Down to a sunless sea.\
So twice five miles of fertile ground\
With walls and towers were girdled round:\
And there were gardens bright with sinuous rills,\
Where blossomed many an incense-bearing tree;\
And here were forest ancient as the hills,\
Enfolding sunny spots of greenery.\

Cannot be heard, cannot be smelt.\
It lies behind starts and under hills,\
And empty holes it fills.\
It comes first and follows after,\
Ends life, kills laughter.\

It hangs down from the chandelier\
Nobody knows quite what it does\
Its color is odd and its shape is weird\
It emits a high-sounding buzz\
It grows a couple of feet each day\
and wriggles with sort of a twitch\
Nobody bugs it 'cause it comes from\

It happened long ago\
In the new magic land\
The Indians and the buffalo\
Existed hand in hand\
The Indians needed food\
They need skins for a roof\
They only took what they needed\
And the buffalo ran loose\

With his thick and empty head\

He wanted all the buffalo dead\
It was sad, oh so sad.\

I come before you to stand behind you\
To tell you of something I know nothing about.\
Next Thursday (which is good Friday),\
There will be a convention held in the\

Admission is free, pay at the door,\
Pull up a chair, and sit on the floor.\
It was a summer's day in winter,\
And the snow was raining fast,\
As a barefoot boy with shoes on,\
Stood sitting in the grass.\
Oh, that bright day in the dead of night,\
Two dead men got up to fight.\
Three blind men to see fair play,\
Forty mutes to yell "Hooray"!\
Back to back, they faced each other,\
Drew their swords and shot each other.\
A deaf policeman heard the noise,\
Came and arrested those two dead boys.\

And please stay at home if you can possibly be there.\
Admission is free, please pay at the door.\
Have a seat on me: please sit on the floor.\
No matter where you manage to sit,\
The man in the balcony will certainly spit.\
We thank you for your unkind attention,\

Let me not to the marriage of true minds\
Admit impediments.\'a0 Love is not love\
Which alters when it alteration finds,\
Or bends with the remover to remove:\
O, no! it is an ever-fixed mark,\
That looks on tempests and is never shaken;\
It is the star to every wandering bark,\
Whose worth's unknown, although his height be taken.\
Love's not Time's fool, though rosy lips and cheeks\
Within his bending sickle's compass come;\
Love alters not with his brief hours and weeks,\
But bears it out even to the edge of doom.\
If this be error and upon me proved,\
I never writ, nor no man ever loved.\

Sing a song full of the hope that the present has bought us.\
Facing the rising sun of our new day begun,\
Let us march on till victory is won.\

Well, I hit him hard right between the eyes,\
And he went down, but to my surprise,\
Come up with a knife and cut off a piece of my ear.\
So I busted a chair right across his teeth,\
And we crashed through the walls and into the streets,\
Kickin' and a-gougin' in the mud and the blood and beer.\
Now I tell you, I've fought tougher men,\
But I really can't remember when:\
He kicked like a mule and he bit like a crocodile.\
But I heard him laugh and then I heard him cuss,\
And he went for his gun, but I pulled mine first,\
And he sat there lookin' at me, and I saw him smile.\
He said: "Son, this world is rough,\
And if a man's gonna make it he's gotta be tough,\
And I knew I wouldn't be there to help you along.\
So I give you that name and I said goodbye,\
And I knew you'd have to get tough or die,\
And it's that name that's helped to make you strong!\

lived an old man\
with a blind dog\
Every evening I would see him\
guiding the dog along\
the sidewalk, keeping\
a firm grip on the leash\
so that the dog wouldn't\
run into a passerby\
Sometimes the dog would stop\

You go strolling through the crowd like Peter Lorre contemplating a crime.\
She comes out of the sun in a silk dress running like a watercolor in the rain.\
Don't bother asking for explanations, she'll just tell you that she came\
In the Year of the Cat.\
She doesn't give you time for questions, as she locks up your arm in hers,\
And you follow 'till your sense of which direction completely disappears.\
By the blue-tiled walls near the market stall there's a hidden door she\
\'a0\'a0\'a0 leads you to.\
These days, she say, I feel my life just like a river running through\
The Year of the Cat.\
Well, she looks at you so coolly,\
And her eyes shine like the moon in the sea.\
She comes in incense and patchouli,\
So you take her to find what's waiting inside\
The Year of the Cat.\
Well, morning comes and you're still with her, but the bus and the tourists\
\'a0\'a0\'a0 are gone,\
And you've thrown away your choice and lost your ticket, so you have to stay on.\
But the drum-beat strains of the night remain in the rhythm of the new-born day.\
You know some time you're bound to leave her, but for now you're going to stay\
In the Year of the Cat.\

On the good ship Enterprise\
Every week there's a new surprise\
Where the Romulans lurk\
And the Klingons often go berserk.\
Yes, the good ship Enterprise\
There's excitement anywhere it flies\
Where Tribbles play\
And Nurse Chapel never gets her way.\
\'a0\'a0\'a0 See Captain Kirk standing on the bridge,\
\'a0\'a0\'a0 Mr. Spock is at his side.\
\'a0\'a0\'a0 The weekly menace, ooh-ooh\
\'a0\'a0\'a0 It gets fried, scattered far and wide.\

Heading out where danger lies\
And you live in dread\

Once again dread deed is done.\
Canon sleeps,\
his all-knowing eye shaded\
to human chance and circumstance.\
Peace reigns anew o'er Pine Valley,\
but Canon's sleep is troubled.\
Beware, scant days past the Ides of July.\
Impatient hands wait eagerly\
to grasp, to hold\
scant moments of time\
wrested from life in the full\
glory of Canon's power;\
held captive by his unblinking eye.\
Three golden orbs stand watch;\
one each to toll the day, hour, minute\

Once there was a little nerd who loved to read your mail,\
And then yank back the i-access times to get hackers off his tail,\
And once as he finished reading from the secretary's spool,\
He wrote a rude rejection to her boyfriend (how uncool!)\
And this as delivermail did work and he ran his backfstat,\
He heard an awful crackling like rat fritters in hot fat,\
And hard errors brought the system down 'fore he could even shout!\
\'a0\'a0\'a0 And the bio bug'll bring yours down too, ef you don't watch out!\
And once they was a little flake who'd prowl through the uulog,\
And when he went to his blit that night to play at being god,\
The ops all heard him holler, and they to the console dashed,\
But when they did a ps -ut they found the system crashed!\
Oh, the wizards adb'd the dumps and did the system trace,\
And worked on the file system 'til the disk head was hot paste,\
But all they ever found was this:\'a0 "panic: never doubt",\

When the day is done and the moon comes out,\
And you hear the printer whining and the rk's seems to count,\
When the other desks are empty and their terminals glassy grey,\
And the load is only 1.6 and you wonder if it'll stay,\
You must mind the file protections and not snoop around,\
\'a0\'a0\'a0 Or the bio bug'll getcha and bring the system down!\

Once upon this midnight incoherent,\
While you pondered sentient and crystalline,\

While I pestered, nearly singing,\
Sudddenly there came a hewing,\

Skulking at my chamber door.\

One bright Sunday morning, in the shadows of the steeple,\
By the Relief Office, I seen my people;\
As they stood there hungry, I stood there whistling,\
This land was made for you and me.\
Nobody living can ever stop me,\
As I go walking that freedom highway;\
Nobody living can ever make me turn back,\
This land was made for you and me.\
As I went walking, I saw a sign there,\
And on the sign it said: "No Trespassing."\
But on the other side, it didn't say nothing,\
That side was made for you and me.\

And light of stars was in her hair,\
And in her raiment glimmering.\

And lost he wandered under leaves,\
And where the Elven-river rolled\
He walked alone and sorrowing.\
He peered between the hemlock-leaves\
And saw in wonder flowers of gold\
Upon her mantle and her sleeves,\
And her hair like shadow following.\
Enchantment healed his weary feet\
That over hills were doomed to roam;\
And forth he hastened, strong and fleet,\
And grasped at moonbeams glistening.\

And left him lonely still to roam\

The Poet Whose Badness Saved His Life\
\'a0\'a0\'a0 The most important poet in the seventeenth century was George\
Wither.\'a0 Alexander Pope called him "wretched Wither" and Dryden said of his\
verse that "if they rhymed and rattled all was well".\
\'a0\'a0\'a0 In our own time, "The Dictionary of National Biography" notes that his\
work "is mainly remarkable for its mass, fluidity and flatness.\'a0 It usually\
lacks any genuine literary quality and often sinks into imbecile doggerel".\
\'a0\'a0\'a0 High praise, indeed, and it may tempt you to savour a typically\
rewarding stanza: It is taken from "I loved a lass" and is concerned with\
the higher emotions.\
\'a0\'a0\'a0 \'a0\'a0\'a0 She would me "Honey" call,\
\'a0\'a0\'a0 \'a0\'a0\'a0 She'd -- O she'd kiss me too.\
\'a0\'a0\'a0 \'a0\'a0\'a0 But now alas!\'a0 She's left me\
\'a0\'a0\'a0 \'a0\'a0\'a0 Falero, lero, loo.\
\'a0\'a0\'a0 Among other details of his mistress which he chose to immortalize\
was her prudent choice of footwear.\
\'a0\'a0\'a0 \'a0\'a0\'a0 The fives did fit her shoe.\
\'a0\'a0\'a0 In 1639 the great poet's life was endangered after his capture by\
the Royalists during the English Civil War.\'a0 When Sir John Denham, the\
Royalist poet, heard of Wither's imminent execution, he went to the King and\
begged that his life be spared.\'a0 When asked his reason, Sir John replied,\
"Because that so long as Wither lived, Denham would not be accounted the\
worst poet in England."\

The Worst American Poet\
\'a0\'a0\'a0 Julia Moore, "the Sweet Singer of Michigan" (1847-1920) was so bad that\
Mark Twain said her first book gave him joy for 20 years.\
\'a0\'a0\'a0 Her verse was mainly concerned with violent death -- the great fire\
of Chicago and the yellow fever epidemic proved natural subjects for her pen.\
\'a0\'a0\'a0 Whether death was by drowning, by fits or by runaway sleigh, the\
formula was the same:\
\'a0\'a0\'a0 \'a0\'a0\'a0 Have you heard of the dreadful fate\
\'a0\'a0\'a0 \'a0\'a0\'a0 Of Mr. P. P. Bliss and wife?\
\'a0\'a0\'a0 \'a0\'a0\'a0 Of their death I will relate,\
\'a0\'a0\'a0 \'a0\'a0\'a0 And also others lost their life\
\'a0\'a0\'a0 \'a0\'a0\'a0 (in the) Ashbula Bridge disaster,\
\'a0\'a0\'a0 \'a0\'a0\'a0 Where so many people died.\
\'a0\'a0\'a0 Even if you started out reasonably healthy in one of Julia's poems,\
the chances are that after a few stanzas you would be at the bottom of a\
river or struck by lightning.\'a0 A critic of the day said she was "worse than\
a Gatling gun" and in one slim volume counted 21 killed and 9 wounded.\
\'a0\'a0\'a0 Incredibly, some newspapers were critical of her work, even\
suggesting that the sweet singer was "semi-literate".\'a0 Her reply was\
forthright: "The Editors that has spoken in this scandalous manner have went\
beyond reason."\'a0 She added that "literary work is very difficult to do".\

\'a0\'a0\'a0 \'a0\'a0\'a0 The Worst Lines of Verse\
For a start, we can rule out James Grainger's promising line:\
\'a0\'a0\'a0 "Come, muse, let us sing of rats."\
Grainger (1721-67) did not have the courage of his convictions and deleted\
these words on discovering that his listeners dissolved into spontaneous\
laughter the instant they were read out.\
\'a0\'a0\'a0 No such reluctance afflicted Adam Lindsay Gordon (1833-70) who was\
inspired by the subject of war.\
\'a0\'a0\'a0 "Flash! flash! bang! bang! and we blazed away,\
\'a0\'a0\'a0 And the grey roof reddened and rang;\
\'a0\'a0\'a0 Flash! flash! and I felt his bullet flay\
\'a0\'a0\'a0 The tip of my ear.\'a0 Flash! bang!"\
By contrast, Cheshire cheese provoked John Armstrong (1709-79):\
\'a0\'a0\'a0 "... that which Cestria sends, tenacious paste of solid milk..."\
While John Bidlake was guided by a compassion for vegetables:\
\'a0\'a0\'a0 "The sluggard carrot sleeps his day in bed,\
\'a0\'a0\'a0 The crippled pea alone that cannot stand."\
George Crabbe (1754-1832) wrote:\
\'a0\'a0\'a0 "And I was ask'd and authorized to go\
\'a0\'a0\'a0 To seek the firm of Clutterbuck and Co."\
William Balmford explored the possibilities of religious verse:\
\'a0\'a0\'a0 "So 'tis with Christians, Nature being weak\
\'a0\'a0\'a0 While in this world, are liable to leak."\
And William Wordsworth showed that he could do it if he really tried when\
describing a pond:\
\'a0\'a0\'a0 "I've measured it from side to side;\
\'a0\'a0\'a0 Tis three feet long and two feet wide."\

To write a sonnet you must ruthlessly\
strip down your words to naked, willing flesh.\
Then bind them to a metaphor or three,\
and take by force a satisfying mesh.\
Arrange them to your will, each foot in place.\
You are the master here, and they the slaves.\
Now whip them to maintain a constant pace\
and rhythm as they stand in even staves.\
A word that strikes no pleasure?\'a0 Cast it out!\
What use are words that drive not to the heart?\
A lazy phrase? Discard it, shrug off doubt,\
and choose more docile words to take its part.\
A well-trained sonnet lives to entertain,\
by making love directly to the brain.\

The headline screamed that I was still alive,\
I couldn't understand it, I thought I died last night.\
I dreamed I'd been in a border town,\
In a little cantina that the boys had found,\
I was desperate to dance, just to dig the local sounds.\
When along came a senorita,\
She looked so good that I had to meet her,\
I was ready to approach her with my English charm,\
When her brass knuckled boyfriend grabbed me by the arm,\
And he said, grow some funk of your own, amigo,\
Grow some funk of your own.\
We no like to with the gringo fight,\
But there might be a death in Mexico tonite.\

And grow some funk, grow your funk at home.\

Professor Doberman:\
\'a0\'a0\'a0 While the preceding poem is unarguably a change from the guarded\
pessimism of "The Hound of Heaven," it cannot be regarded as an unqualified\
improvement.\'a0 Obscurity is of value only when it tends to clarify the poetic\
experience.\'a0 As much as one is compelled to admire the poem's technique, one\
must question whether its byplay of complex literary allusions does not in\
fact distract from the unity of the whole.\'a0 In the final analysis, one\
receives the distinct impression that the poem's length could safely have\
been reduced by a factor of eight or ten without sacrificing any of its\
meaning.\'a0 It is to be hoped that further publication of this poem can be\
suspended pending a thorough investigation of its potential subversive\
implications.\

Yesterday upon the stair\
I met a man who wasn't there.\
He wasn't there again today --\
I think he's from the CIA.\

"You are old, Father William," the young man said,\
\'a0\'a0\'a0 "All your papers these days look the same;\
Those William's would be better unread --\
\'a0\'a0\'a0 Do these facts never fill you with shame?"\
"In my youth," Father William replied to his son,\
\'a0\'a0\'a0 "I wrote wonderful papers galore;\
But the great reputation I found that I'd won,\
\'a0\'a0\'a0 Made it pointless to think any more."\
%\
"You are old, father William," the young man said,\
\'a0\'a0\'a0 "And your hair has become very white;\
And yet you incessantly stand on your head --\
\'a0\'a0\'a0 Do you think, at your age, it is right?"\
"In my youth," father William replied to his son,\
\'a0\'a0\'a0 "I feared it might injure the brain;\
But, now that I'm perfectly sure I have none,\
\'a0\'a0\'a0 Why, I do it again and again."\
"You are old," said the youth, "as I mentioned before,\
\'a0\'a0\'a0 And have grown most uncommonly fat;\
Yet you turned a back-somersault in at the door --\
\'a0\'a0\'a0 Pray what is the reason of that?"\
"In my youth," said the sage, as he shook his grey locks,\
\'a0\'a0\'a0 "I kept all my limbs very supple\
By the use of this ointment -- one shilling the box --\
\'a0\'a0\'a0 Allow me to sell you a couple?"\
%\
"You are old," said the youth, "and I'm told by my peers\
\'a0\'a0\'a0 That your lectures bore people to death.\
Yet you talk at one hundred conventions per year --\
\'a0\'a0\'a0 Don't you think that you should save your breath?"\
"I have answered three questions and that is enough,"\
\'a0\'a0\'a0 Said his father, "Don't give yourself airs!\
Do you think I can listen all day to such stuff?\
\'a0\'a0\'a0 Be off, or I'll kick you downstairs!"\
%\
"You are old," said the youth, "and your jaws are too weak\
\'a0\'a0\'a0 For anything tougher than suet;\
Yet you finished the goose, with the bones and the beak --\
\'a0\'a0\'a0 Pray, how did you manage to do it?"\
"In my youth," said his father, "I took to the law,\
\'a0\'a0\'a0 And argued each case with my wife;\
And the muscular strength which it gave to my jaw,\
\'a0\'a0\'a0 Has lasted the rest of my life."\
"You are old," said the youth, "one would hardly suppose\
\'a0\'a0\'a0 That your eye was as steady as ever;\
Yet you balanced an eel on the end of your nose --\
\'a0\'a0\'a0 What made you so awfully clever?"\
"I have answered three questions, and that is enough,"\
\'a0\'a0\'a0 Said his father.\'a0 "Don't give yourself airs!\
Do you think I can listen all day to such stuff?\
\'a0\'a0\'a0 Be off, or I'll kick you down stairs!"\
%\
"You are old," said the youth, "and your programs don't run,\
\'a0\'a0\'a0 And there isn't one language you like;\
Yet of useful suggestions for help you have none --\
\'a0\'a0\'a0 Have you thought about taking a hike?"\
"Since I never write programs," his father replied,\
\'a0\'a0\'a0 "Every language looks equally bad;\
Yet the people keep paying to read all my books\
\'a0\'a0\'a0 And don't realize that they've been had."\
%\
"You are old," said the youth, "as I mentioned before,\
\'a0\'a0\'a0 And make errors few people could bear;\
You complain about everyone's English but yours --\
\'a0\'a0\'a0 Do you really think this is quite fair?"\
"I make lots of mistakes," Father William declared,\
\'a0\'a0\'a0 "But my stature these days is so great\
That no critic can hurt me -- I've got them all scared,\
\'a0\'a0\'a0 And to stop me it's now far too late."\

You can grovel with a lover, you can grovel with a friend,\

\'a0\'a0\'a0 \'a0\'a0\'a0 Grovel, grovel, grovel, in your own peculiar way.\
You can grovel in a hallway, you can grovel in a park,\
You can grovel in an alley with a mugger after dark.\

You can grovel with your uncle, you can grovel with your aunt,\
You can grovel with your Apple, even though you say you can't.\

You go down to the pickup station,\
\'a0\'a0\'a0 craving warmth and beauty;\
You settle for less than fascination --\
\'a0\'a0\'a0 a few drinks later you're not so choosy.\
And the closing lights strip off the shadows\
\'a0\'a0\'a0 on this strange new flesh you've found --\
Clutching the night to you like a fig leaf\
\'a0\'a0\'a0 you hurry to the blackness\
\'a0\'a0\'a0 and the blankets to lay down an impression\
\'a0\'a0\'a0 and your loneliness.\

You got to pay your dues if you want to sing the blues,\
And you know it don't come easy ...\

And you know it don't come easy ...\

You know my heart keeps tellin' me,\
You're not a kid at thirty-three,\
You play around you lose your wife,\
You play too long, you lose your life.\
Some gotta win, some gotta lose,\
Goodtime Charlie's got the blues.\

Yours is not to reason why,\
Just to Sail Away.\
And when you find you have to throw\
Your Legacy away;\
