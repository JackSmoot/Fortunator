A certain monk had a habit of pestering the Grand Tortue (the only one who\
had ever reached the Enlightenment 'Yond Enlightenment), by asking whether\
various objects had Buddha-nature or not.\'a0 To such a question Tortue\
invariably sat silent.\'a0 The monk had already asked about a bean, a lake,\
and a moonlit night.\'a0 One day he brought to Tortue a piece of string, and\
asked the same question.\'a0 In reply, the Grand Tortue grasped the loop\
between his feet and, with a few simple manipulations, created a complex\
string which he proferred wordlessly to the monk.\'a0 At that moment, the monk\
was enlightened.\
From then on, the monk did not bother Tortue.\'a0 Instead, he made string after\
string by Tortue's method; and he passed the method on to his own disciples,\
who passed it on to theirs.\

refused it, saying, "I wrote the program because I though it was an interesting\
concept, and thus I expect no reward."\
\'a0\'a0\'a0 The manager, upon hearing this, remarked, "This programmer, though he\
holds a position of small esteem, understands well the proper duty of an\
employee.\'a0 Lets promote him to the exalted position of management consultant!"\
\'a0\'a0\'a0 But when told this, the programmer once more refused, saying, "I exist\

resigned on the spot.\
\'a0\'a0\'a0 So the manager said: "All right, in that case you may set your own\

Why is this so?"\

company is large because it is so large.\'a0 If it only made hardware, nobody\

\'a0\'a0\'a0 A sheet of paper crossed my desk the other day and as I read it,\
realization of a basic truth came over me.\'a0 So simple!\'a0 So obvious we couldn't\
see it.\'a0 John Knivlen, Chairman of Polamar Repeater Club, an amateur radio\
group, had discovered how IC circuits work.\'a0 He says that smoke is the thing\
that makes ICs work because every time you let the smoke out of an IC circuit,\
it stops working.\'a0 He claims to have verified this with thorough testing.\
\'a0\'a0\'a0 I was flabbergasted!\'a0 Of course!\'a0 Smoke makes all things electrical\
work.\'a0 Remember the last time smoke escaped from your Lucas voltage regulator\
Didn't it quit working?\'a0 I sat and smiled like an idiot as more of the truth\
dawned.\'a0 It's the wiring harness that carries the smoke from one device to\
another in your Mini, MG or Jag.\'a0 And when the harness springs a leak, it lets\
the smoke out of everything at once, and then nothing works.\'a0 The starter motor\
requires large quantities of smoke to operate properly, and that's why the wire\
going to it is so large.\
\'a0\'a0\'a0 Feeling very smug, I continued to expand my hypothesis.\'a0 Why are Lucas\
electronics more likely to leak than say Bosch?\'a0 Hmmm...\'a0 Aha!!!\'a0 Lucas is\
British, and all things British leak!\'a0 British convertible tops leak water,\
British engines leak oil, British displacer units leak hydrostatic fluid, and\
I might add Brititsh tires leak air, and the British defense unit leaks\
secrets... so naturally British electronics leak smoke.\

CAR and CDR now return extra values.\
The function CAR now returns two values.\'a0 Since it has to go to the trouble\
to figure out if the object is carcdr-able anyway, we figured you might as\
well get both halves at once.\'a0 For example, the following code shows how to\
destructure a cons (SOME-CONS) into its two slots (THE-CAR and THE-CDR):\
\'a0\'a0\'a0 (MULTIPLE-VALUE-BIND (THE-CAR THE-CDR) (CAR SOME-CONS) ...)\
For symmetry with CAR, CDR returns a second value which is the CAR of the\
object.\'a0 In a related change, the functions MAKE-ARRAY and CONS have been\
fixed so they don't allocate any storage except on the stack.\'a0 This should\
hopefully help people who don't like using the garbage collector because\
it cold boots the machine so often.\

\'a0\'a0\'a0 (LET ((LET '`(LET ((LET ',LET))\
\'a0\'a0\'a0 \'a0\'a0\'a0 \'a0\'a0\'a0 ,LET)))\
\'a0\'a0\'a0 `(LET ((LET ',LET))\

we have developed an OS/360-compatible JCL.\'a0 This can be used as an\
alternative to the standard system menu.\'a0 Type System J to get to a JCL\

such as dataset allocation, core allocation, channels, etc.\'a0 When a JCL\
syntax error is detected or your job ABENDs, the window-oriented JCL\

The garbage collector now works.\'a0 In addition a new, experimental garbage\
collection algorithm has been installed.\'a0 With SI:%DSK-GC-QLX-BITS set to 17,\
(NOT the default) the old garbage collection algorithm remains in force; when\
virtual storage is filled, the machine cold boots itself.\'a0 With SI:%DSK-GC-\
QLX-BITS set to 23, the new garbage collector is enabled.\'a0 Unlike most garbage\
collectors, the new gc starts its mark phase from the mind of the user, rather\
than from the obarray.\'a0 This allows the garbage collection of significantly\
more Qs.\'a0 As the garbage collector runs, it may ask you something like "Do you\
remember what SI:RDTBL-TRANS does?", and if you can't give a reasonable answer\
in thirty seconds, the symbol becomes a candidate for GCing.\'a0 The variable\
SI:%GC-QLX-LUSER-TM governs how long the GC waits before timing out the user.\

... an anecdote from IBM's Yorktown Heights Research Center.\'a0 When a\
programmer used his new computer terminal, all was fine when he was sitting\
down, but he couldn't log in to the system when he was standing up.\'a0 That\
behavior was 100 percent repeatable: he could always log in when sitting and\
never when standing.\
Most of us just sit back and marvel at such a story; how could that terminal\
know whether the poor guy was sitting or standing?\'a0 Good debuggers, though,\
know that there has to be a reason.\'a0 Electrical theories are the easiest to\
hypothesize: was there a loose wire under the carpet, or problems with static\
electricity?\'a0 But electrical problems are rarely consistently reproducible.\
An alert IBMer finally noticed that the problem was in the terminal's keyboard:\
the tops of two keys were switched.\'a0 When the programmer was seated he was a\
touch typist and the problem went unnoticed, but when he stood he was led\
astray by hunting and pecking.\

Comparing software engineering to classical engineering assumes that software\
has the ability to wear out.\'a0 Software typically behaves, or it does not.\'a0 It\
either works, or it does not.\'a0 Software generally does not degrade, abrade,\
stretch, twist, or ablate.\'a0 To treat it as a physical entity, therefore, is\
misapplication of our engineering skills.\'a0 Classical engineering deals with\
the characteristics of hardware; software engineering should deal with the\
characteristics of *software*, and not with hardware or management.\

merely a subnet distribution when the whole net can be done.\'a0 Also put "please\
ignore" on your test messages, since we all know that everybody always skips\
a message with a line like that.\'a0 Don't use a subject like "My sex is female\

all, the net exists to give you an audience.\'a0 Ignore those who suggest you\
should only use groups where you think the article is highly appropriate.\
Pick all groups where anybody might even be slightly interested.\
\'a0\'a0\'a0 Always make sure followups go to all the groups.\'a0 In the rare event\
that you post a followup which contains something original, make sure you\
expand the list of groups.\'a0 Never include a "Followup-to:" line in the\

the Oilers to the Kings.\'a0 Now right away you might think rec.sport.hockey\
would be enough.\'a0 WRONG.\'a0 Many more people might be interested.\'a0 This is a\
big trade!\'a0 Since it's a NEWS article, it belongs in the news.* hierarchy\
as well.\'a0 If you are a news admin, or there is one on your machine, try\
news.admin.\'a0 If not, use news.misc.\
\'a0\'a0\'a0 The Oilers are probably interested in geology, so try sci.physics.\
He is a big star, so post to sci.astro, and sci.space because they are also\
interested in stars.\'a0 Next, his name is Polish sounding.\'a0 So post to\
soc.culture.polish.\'a0 But that group doesn't exist, so cross-post to\
news.groups suggesting it should be created.\'a0 With this many groups of\
interest, your article will be quite bizarre, so post to talk.bizarre as\
well.\'a0 (And post to comp.std.mumps, since they hardly get any articles\
there, and a "comp" group will propagate your article further.)\
\'a0\'a0\'a0 You may also find it is more fun to post the article once in each\
group.\'a0 If you list all the newsgroups in the same article, some newsreaders\
will only show the the article to the reader once!\'a0 Don't tolerate this.\

Ever wondered about the origins of the term "bugs" as applied to computer\
technology?\'a0 U.S. Navy Capt. Grace Murray Hopper has firsthand explanation.\
The 74-year-old captain, who is still on active duty, was a pioneer in\
computer technology during World War II.\'a0 At the C.W. Post Center of Long\
Island University, Hopper told a group of Long Island public school adminis-\
trators that the first computer "bug" was a real bug--a moth.\'a0 At Harvard\
one August night in 1945, Hopper and her associates were working on the\
"granddaddy" of modern computers, the Mark I.\'a0 "Things were going badly;\
there was something wrong in one of the circuits of the long glass-enclosed\
computer," she said.\'a0 "Finally, someone located the trouble spot and, using\
ordinary tweezers, removed the problem, a two-inch moth.\'a0 From then on, when\
anything went wrong with a computer, we said it had bugs in it."\'a0 Hopper\
said that when the veracity of her story was questioned recently, "I referred\
them to my 1945 log book, now in the collection of the Naval Surface Weapons\
Center, and they found the remains of that moth taped to the page in\
question."\
\'a0\'a0\'a0 \'a0\'a0\'a0 [actually, the term "bug" had even earlier usage in\

If you ever want to have a lot of fun, I recommend that you go off and program\

it cannot be allowed to get into a state from which only direct intervention\
will suffice to remove it.\'a0 An imbedded system can't permanently trust anything\
it hears from the outside world.\'a0 It must sniff around, adapt, consider, sniff\
around, and adapt again.\'a0 I'm not talking about ordinary modular programming\
carefulness here.\'a0 No.\'a0 Programming an imbedded system calls for undiluted\
raging maniacal paranoia.\'a0 For example, our ethernet front ends need to know\
what network number they are on so that they can address and route PUPs\
properly.\'a0 How do you find out what your network number is?\'a0 Easy, you ask a\
gateway.\'a0 Gateways are required by definition to know their correct network\
numbers.\'a0 Once you've got your network number, you start using it and before\
you can blink you've got it wired into fifteen different sockets spread all\
over creation.\'a0 Now what happens when the panic-stricken operator realizes he\
was running the wrong version of the gateway which was giving out the wrong\
network number?\'a0 Never supposed to happen.\'a0 Tough.\'a0 Supposing that your\
software discovers that the gateway is now giving out a different network\
number than before, what's it supposed to do about it?\'a0 This is not discussed\
in the protocol document.\'a0 Never supposed to happen.\'a0 Tough.\'a0 I think you\

could write the specifications and do it right.\'a0 It would take ten months,\
three more than the schedule allowed.\
\'a0\'a0\'a0 The control program manager had 150 men.\'a0 He asserted that they\
could prepare the specifications, with the architecture team coordinating;\
it would be well-done and practical, and he could do it on schedule.\
Furthermore, if the architecture team did it, his 150 men would sit twiddling\
their thumbs for ten months.\
\'a0\'a0\'a0 To this the architecture manager responded that if I gave the control\
program team the responsibility, the result would not in fact be on time,\
but would also be three months late, and of much lower quality.\'a0 I did, and\
it was.\'a0 He was right on both counts.\'a0 Moreover, the lack of conceptual\

Norbert Weiner was the subject of many dotty professor stories.\'a0 Weiner was, in\
fact, very absent minded.\'a0 The following story is told about him: when they\
moved from Cambridge to Newton his wife, knowing that he would be absolutely\
useless on the move, packed him off to MIT while she directed the move.\'a0 Since\
she was certain that he would forget that they had moved and where they had\
moved to, she wrote down the new address on a piece of paper, and gave it to\
him.\'a0 Naturally, in the course of the day, an insight occurred to him.\'a0 He\
reached in his pocket, found a piece of paper on which he furiously scribbled\
some notes, thought it over, decided there was a fallacy in his idea, and\
threw the piece of paper away.\'a0 At the end of the day he went home (to the\
old address in Cambridge, of course).\'a0 When he got there he realized that they\
had moved, that he had no idea where they had moved to, and that the piece of\
paper with the address was long gone.\'a0 Fortunately inspiration struck.\'a0 There\
was a young girl on the street and he conceived the idea of asking her where\
he had moved to, saying, "Excuse me, perhaps you know me.\'a0 I'm Norbert Weiner\
and we've just moved.\'a0 Would you know where we've moved to?"\'a0 To which the\
young girl replied, "Yes, Daddy, Mommy thought you would forget."\
\'a0\'a0\'a0 The capper to the story is that I asked his daughter (the girl in the\
story) about the truth of the story, many years later.\'a0 She said that it wasn't\
quite true -- that he never forgot who his children were!\'a0 The rest of it,\
however, was pretty close to what actually happened...\

\'a0\'a0\'a0 On the other hand, the TCP camp also has a phrase for OSI people.\
There are lots of phrases.\'a0 My favorite is `nitwit' -- and the rationale\
is the Internet philosophy has always been you have extremely bright,\
non-partisan researchers look at a topic, do world-class research, do\
several competing implementations, have a bake-off, determine what works\
best, write it down and make that the standard.\
\'a0\'a0\'a0 The OSI view is entirely opposite.\'a0 You take written contributions\
from a much larger community, you put the contributions in a room of\
committee people with, quite honestly, vast political differences and all\
with their own political axes to grind, and four years later you get\
something out, usually without it ever having been implemented once.\
\'a0\'a0\'a0 So the Internet perspective is implement it, make it work well,\
then write it down, whereas the OSI perspective is to agree on it, write\
it down, circulate it a lot and now we'll see if anyone can implement it\
after it's an international standard and every vendor in the world is\
committed to it.\'a0 One of those processes is backwards, and I don't think\

\'a0\'a0\'a0 One of the questions that comes up all the time is: How enthusiastic\
is our support for UNIX?\
\'a0\'a0\'a0 Unix was written on our machines and for our machines many years ago.\
Today, much of UNIX being done is done on our machines. Ten percent of our\
VAXs are going for UNIX use.\'a0 UNIX is a simple language, easy to understand,\
easy to get started with. It's great for students, great for somewhat casual\
users, and it's great for interchanging programs between different machines.\
And so, because of its popularity in these markets, we support it.\'a0 We have\
good UNIX on VAX and good UNIX on PDP-11s.\
\'a0\'a0\'a0 It is our belief, however, that serious professional users will run\
out of things they can do with UNIX. They'll want a real system and will end\
up doing VMS when they get to be serious about programming.\
\'a0\'a0\'a0 With UNIX, if you're looking for something, you can easily and quickly\
check that small manual and find out that it's not there.\'a0 With VMS, no matter\
what you look for -- it's literally a five-foot shelf of documentation -- if\
you look long enough it's there.\'a0 That's the difference -- the beauty of UNIX\
is it's simple; and the beauty of VMS is that it's all there.\

Overall, the philosophy is to attack the availability problem from two\
complementary directions:\'a0 to reduce the number of software errors through\
rigorous testing of running systems, and to reduce the effect of the remaining\
errors by providing for recovery from them.\'a0 An interesting footnote to this\
design is that now a system failure can usually be considered to be the\
result of two program errors:\'a0 the first, in the program that started the\
problem; the second, in the recovery routine that could not protect the\
system.\

Speaker:\'a0\'a0\'a0 Don "The Lion" Knuth\
\'a0\'a0\'a0 \'a0\'a0\'a0 \'a0\'a0\'a0 \'a0\'a0\'a0 ABSTRACT\
\'a0\'a0\'a0 Several researchers at the University of Louisiana have been studying\
the computing power of various amphibians, frogs in particular.\'a0 The problem\
of frog computability has become a critical issue that ranges across all areas\
of computer science.\'a0 It has been shown that anything computable by an amphi-\
bian community in a fixed-size pond is computable by a frog in the same-size\
pond -- that is to say, frogs are Pond-space complete.\'a0 We will show that\
there is a log-space, polywog-time reduction from any Turing machine program\
to a frog.\'a0 We will suggest these represent a proper subset of frog-computable\
functions.\
\'a0\'a0\'a0 This is not just a let's-see-how-far-those-frogs-can-jump seminar.\
This is only for hardcore amphibian-computation people and their colleagues.\

\'a0\'a0\'a0 The first student to try to do this was a math student.\'a0 "Hmmm...\
Well, 1 is prime, 3 is prime, 5 is prime, and by induction, we have that all\
the odd integers are prime."\
\'a0\'a0\'a0 The second student to try was a man of physics who commented, "I'm not\
sure of the validity of your proof, but I think I'll try to prove it by\
experiment."\'a0 He continues, "Well, 1 is prime, 3 is prime, 5 is prime, 7 is\
prime, 9 is...\'a0 uh, 9 is... uh, 9 is an experimental error, 11 is prime, 13\
is prime...\'a0 Well, it seems that you're right."\
\'a0\'a0\'a0 The third student to try it was the engineering student, who responded,\
"Well, to be honest, actually, I'm not sure of your answer either.\'a0 Let's\
see...\'a0 1 is prime, 3 is prime, 5 is prime, 7 is prime, 9 is... uh, 9 is...\
well, if you approximate, 9 is prime, 11 is prime, 13 is prime...\'a0 Well, it\
does seem right."\
\'a0\'a0\'a0 Not to be outdone, the computer science student comes along and says\
"Well, you two sort've got the right idea, but you'll end up taking too long!\
I've just whipped up a program to REALLY go and prove it."\'a0 He goes over to\
his terminal and runs his program.\'a0 Reading the output on the screen he says,\
"1 is prime, 1 is prime, 1 is prime, 1 is prime..."\

***** Special AI Seminar (abstract)\
It has been widely recognized that AI programs require expert knowledge\
in order to perform well in complex domains.\'a0 But knowledge alone is not\
sufficient for some applications; wisdom is needed as well.\'a0 Accordingly,\
we have developed a new approach to artificial intelligence which we call\
"wisdom engineering".\'a0 As a test of our ideas, we have written IMMANUEL, a\
wisdom based system for the task domain of western philosophical thought.\
IMMANUEL was supplied initially with 200 wisdom units which contained wisdom\
about such elementary concepts as mind, matter, being, nothingness, and so\
forth.\'a0 IMMANUEL was then allowed to run freely, guided by the heuristic\
rules contained in its heterarchically organized meta wisdom base.\'a0 IMMANUEL\
succeeded in rediscovering most of the important philosophical ideas developed\
in western culture over the course of the last 25 centuries, including those\
underlying Plato's theory of government, Kant's metaphysics, Nietzsche's theory\
of value, and Husserl's phenomenology.\'a0 In this seminar, we will describe\
IMMANUEL's achievements and internal architecture.\'a0 We will also briefly\
discuss our recent efforts to apply wisdom engineering to oil exploration.\

\'a0\'a0\'a0 THE LESSER-KNOWN PROGRAMMING LANGUAGES #10: SIMPLE\
SIMPLE is an acronym for Sheer Idiot's Monopurpose Programming Language\
Environment.\'a0 This language, developed at the Hanover College for\
Technological Misfits, was designed to make it impossible to write code\
with errors in it.\'a0 The statements are, therefore, confined to BEGIN,\
END and STOP.\'a0 No matter how you arrange the statements, you can't make\
a syntax error.\'a0 Programs written in SIMPLE do nothing useful.\'a0 Thus\
they achieve the results of programs written in other languages without\
the tedious, frustrating process of testing and debugging.\
%\
\'a0\'a0\'a0 THE LESSER-KNOWN PROGRAMMING LANGUAGES #12: LITHP\

to be useful in protheththing lithtth.\
%\
\'a0\'a0\'a0 THE LESSER-KNOWN PROGRAMMING LANGUAGES #13: SLOBOL\
SLOBOL is best known for the speed, or lack of it, of its compiler.\
Although many compilers allow you to take a coffee break while they\
compile, SLOBOL compilers allow you to travel to Bolivia to pick the\
coffee.\'a0 Forty-three programmers are known to have died of boredom\
sitting at their terminals while waiting for a SLOBOL program to\
compile.\'a0 Weary SLOBOL programmers often turn to a related (but\
infinitely faster) language, COCAINE.\
%\
\'a0\'a0\'a0 THE LESSER-KNOWN PROGRAMMING LANGUAGES #14 -- VALGOL\
\'a0\'a0\'a0 VALGOL is enjoying a dramatic surge of popularity across the\
industry.\'a0 VALGOL commands include REALLY, LIKE, WELL, and Y*KNOW.\
Variables are assigned with the =LIKE and =TOTALLY operators.\'a0 Other\
operators include the "California booleans", AX and NOWAY.\'a0 Loops are\
accomplished with the FOR SURE construct.\'a0 A simple example:\
\'a0\'a0\'a0 LIKE, Y*KNOW(I MEAN)START\
\'a0\'a0\'a0 IF PIZZA\'a0\'a0\'a0 =LIKE BITCHEN AND\
\'a0\'a0\'a0 GUY\'a0\'a0\'a0 \'a0\'a0\'a0 =LIKE TUBULAR AND\
\'a0\'a0\'a0 VALLEY GIRL\'a0\'a0\'a0 =LIKE GRODY**MAX(FERSURE)**2\
\'a0\'a0\'a0 THEN\
\'a0\'a0\'a0 \'a0\'a0\'a0 FOR I =LIKE 1 TO OH*MAYBE 100\
\'a0\'a0\'a0 \'a0\'a0\'a0 \'a0\'a0\'a0 DO*WAH - (DITTY**2); BARF(I)=TOTALLY GROSS(OUT)\
\'a0\'a0\'a0 \'a0\'a0\'a0 SURE\
\'a0\'a0\'a0 LIKE, BAG THIS PROGRAM; REALLY; LIKE TOTALLY(Y*KNOW); IM*SURE\
\'a0\'a0\'a0 GOTO THE MALL\
\'a0\'a0\'a0 VALGOL is also characterized by its unfriendly error messages.\'a0 For\
example, when the user makes a syntax error, the interpreter displays the\
message GAG ME WITH A SPOON!\'a0 A successful compile may be termed MAXIMALLY\

\'a0\'a0\'a0 THE LESSER-KNOWN PROGRAMMING LANGUAGES #16: C-\
This language was named for the grade received by its creator when he\
submitted it as a class project in a graduate programming class.\'a0 C- is best\
described as a "low-level" programming language.\'a0 In fact, the language\
generally requires more C- statements than machine-code statements to\
execute a given task.\'a0 In this respect, it is very similar to COBOL.\
%\
\'a0\'a0\'a0 THE LESSER-KNOWN PROGRAMMING LANGUAGES #17: SARTRE\
Named after the late existential philosopher, SARTRE is an extremely\

Thus SARTRE programs are left to define their own functions. SARTRE\
programmers tend to be boring and depressed, and are no fun at parties.\
%\
\'a0\'a0\'a0 THE LESSER-KNOWN PROGRAMMING LANGUAGES #18: FIFTH\
FIFTH is a precision mathematical language in which the data types\
refer to quantity.\'a0 The data types range from CC, OUNCE, SHOT, and\
JIGGER to FIFTH (hence the name of the language), LITER, MAGNUM and\
BLOTTO.\'a0 Commands refer to ingredients such as CHABLIS, CHARDONNAY,\
CABERNET, GIN, VERMOUTH, VODKA, SCOTCH, and WHATEVERSAROUND.\
The many versions of the FIFTH language reflect the sophistication and\
financial status of its users.\'a0 Commands in the ELITE dialect include\
VSOP and LAFITE, while commands in the GUTTER dialect include HOOTCH\
and RIPPLE. The latter is a favorite of frustrated FORTH programmers\
who end up using this language.\
%\
\'a0\'a0\'a0 THE LESSER-KNOWN PROGRAMMING LANGUAGES #2: RENE\
Named after the famous French philosopher and mathematician Rene DesCartes,\
RENE is a language used for artificial intelligence.\'a0 The language is being\
developed at the Chicago Center of Machine Politics and Programming under a\
grant from the Jane Byrne Victory Fund.\'a0 A spokesman described the language\
as "Just as great as dis [sic] city of ours."\
The center is very pleased with progress to date.\'a0 They say they have almost\
succeeded in getting a VAX to think. However, sources inside the\
organization say that each time the machine fails to think it ceases to exist.\
%\
\'a0\'a0\'a0 THE LESSER-KNOWN PROGRAMMING LANGUAGES #8: LAIDBACK\
This language was developed at the Marin County Center for T'ai Chi,\
Mellowness and Computer Programming (now defunct), as an alternative to\
the more intense atmosphere in nearby Silicon Valley.\
The center was ideal for programmers who liked to soak in hot tubs while\
they worked.\'a0 Unfortunately few programmers could survive there because the\
center outlawed Pizza and Coca-Cola in favor of Tofu and Perrier.\
Many mourn the demise of LAIDBACK because of its reputation as a gentle and\
non-threatening language since all error messages are in lower case.\'a0 For\
example, LAIDBACK responded to syntax errors with the message:\
\'a0\'a0\'a0 "i hate to bother you, but i just can't relate to that.\'a0 can\
\'a0\'a0\'a0 you find the time to try it again?"\

\'a0\'a0\'a0 "Certainly," replied the master, "I will have it transported to the\
data center immediately!"\'a0 And the magician returned to his tower, well\
pleased.\
\'a0\'a0\'a0 Several days later, a novice wandered into the office of the master\
programmer and said, "I cannot find the listing for my new program.\'a0 Do\
you know where it might be?"\
\'a0\'a0\'a0 "Yes," replied the master, "the listings are stacked on the platform\

There has also been some work to allow the interesting use of macro names.\
For example, if you wanted all of your "creat()" calls to include read\
permissions for everyone, you could say\
\'a0\'a0\'a0 #define creat(file, mode)\'a0\'a0\'a0 creat(file, mode | 0444)\
\'a0\'a0\'a0 I would recommend against this kind of thing in general, since it\
hides the changed semantics of "creat()" in a macro, potentially far away\
from its uses.\
\'a0\'a0\'a0 To allow this use of macros, the preprocessor uses a process that\
is worth describing, if for no other reason than that we get to use one of\
the more amusing terms introduced into the C lexicon.\'a0 While a macro is\
being expanded, it is temporarily undefined, and any recurrence of the macro\
name is "painted blue" -- I kid you not, this is the official terminology\
-- so that in future scans of the text the macro will not be expanded\
recursively.\'a0 (I do not know why the color blue was chosen; I'm sure it\
was the result of a long debate, spread over several meetings.)\

forewarned, for this trade show shall not escape unplundered."\
\'a0\'a0\'a0 This speech disturbed the guard greatly, because there were millions\
of dollars of computer equipment inside, so he watched the man carefully.\
But the man merely wandered from booth to booth, humming quietly to himself.\
\'a0\'a0\'a0 When the man left, the guard took him aside and searched his clothes,\
but nothing was to be found.\
\'a0\'a0\'a0 On the next day of the trade show, the man returned and chided the\
guard saying: "I escaped with a vast booty yesterday, but today will be even\
better."\'a0 So the guard watched him ever more closely, but to no avail.\
\'a0\'a0\'a0 On the final day of the trade show, the guard could restrain his\
curiosity no longer. "Sir Thief," he said, "I am so perplexed, I cannot live\
in peace.\'a0 Please enlighten me.\'a0 What is it that you are stealing?"\

\'a0\'a0\'a0 The warlord uttered an exclamation of disbelief.\'a0 "Surely an\
accounting package is trivial next to the complexity of an operating\
system," he said.\
\'a0\'a0\'a0 "Not so," said the programmer, "when designing an accounting package,\
the programmer operates as a mediator between people having different ideas:\
how it must operate, how its reports must appear, and how it must conform to\
the tax laws.\'a0 By contrast, an operating system is not limited my outside\
appearances.\'a0 When designing an operating system, the programmer seeks the\
simplest harmony between machine and ideas.\'a0 This is why an operating system\
is easier to design."\
\'a0\'a0\'a0 The warlord of Wu nodded and smiled.\'a0 "That is all good and well, but\

share my resources with anyone.\'a0 The software is self-consistent and\
easy-to-use.\'a0 Why do you not quit your present job and join me here?"\
\'a0\'a0\'a0 The mainframe programmer then began to describe his system to his\
friend, saying: "The mainframe sits like an ancient sage meditating in the\
midst of the data center.\'a0 Its disk drives lie end-to-end like a great ocean\
of machinery.\'a0 The software is a multi-faceted as a diamond and as convoluted\
as a primeval jungle.\'a0 The programs, each unique, move through the system\
like a swift-flowing river.\'a0 That is why I am happy where I am."\

performing her normal housekeeping routines.\'a0 She was interrupted by\
British soldiers who, rallying to the call of their supervisor, General\
Hughes, sought to gain control of the voter registration lists kept in\
her home.\'a0 Masking her fear and thinking fast, Mrs. Chine quickly divided\
a nearby apple in two and deftly stored the list in its center.\'a0 Upon\
entering, the British blatantly violated every conceivable convention,\
and, though they went through the house virtually bit by bit, their\
search was fruitless.\'a0 They had to return empty handed.\'a0 Word of the\

Unix Beer: Comes in several different brands, in cans ranging from 8 oz.\
to 64 oz.\'a0 Drinkers of Unix Beer display fierce brand loyalty, even\
though they claim that all the different brands taste almost identical.\

to have your own can opener around for those occasions, in which case you\
either need a complete set of instructions, or a friend who has been\
drinking Unix Beer for several years.\

GNU brewery, so far it has more head than body.\'a0 The GNU brewery is\
mostly known for printing complete brewing instructions on every can,\
which contains hops, malt, barley, and yeast ... not yet fermented.\
\'a0\'a0\'a0 Linux brand: A recipe originally created by a drunken Finn in his\
basement, it has since become the home-brew of choice for impecunious\
brewers and Unix beer-lovers worldwide, many of whom change the recipe.\
\'a0\'a0\'a0 POSIX ales: Sweeter than lager, with the kick of a stout; the\
newer batches of a lot of beers seem to blend ale and stout or lager.\
\'a0\'a0\'a0 Solaris brand: A lager, intended to replace Sun brand stout.\
Unlike most lagers, this one has to be drunk more slowly than stout.\
\'a0\'a0\'a0 Sun brand: Long the most popular stout on the Unix market, it was\
discontinued in favor of a lager.\
\'a0\'a0\'a0 SysV lager: Clear and thirst-quenching, but lacking the body of\

to the desperation of the operator.\'a0 Threatening the machine with violence\
only aggravates the situation.\'a0 Likewise, attempts to use another machine\
may cause it to malfunction.\'a0 They belong to the same union.\'a0 Keep cool\

"We invented a new protocol and called it Kermit, after Kermit the Frog,\
star of "The Muppet Show." [3]\
[3]\'a0 Why?\'a0 Mostly because there was a Muppets calendar on the wall when we\
were trying to think of a name, and Kermit is a pleasant, unassuming sort of\
character.\'a0 But since we weren't sure whether it was OK to name our protocol\
after this popular television and movie star, we pretended that KERMIT was an\
acronym; unfortunately, we could never find a good set of words to go with the\
letters, as readers of some of our early source code can attest.\'a0 Later, while\
looking through a name book for his forthcoming baby, Bill Catchings noticed\
that "Kermit" was a Celtic word for "free", which is what all Kermit programs\
should be, and words to this effect replaced the strained acronyms in our\
source code (Bill's baby turned out to be a girl, so he had to name her Becky\
instead).\'a0 When BYTE Magazine was preparing our 1984 Kermit article for\
publication, they suggested we contact Henson Associates Inc. for permission\
to say that we did indeed name the protocol after Kermit the Frog.\'a0 Permission\
was kindly granted, and now the real story can be told.\'a0 I resisted the\
