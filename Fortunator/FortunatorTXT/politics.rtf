Gentlemen,\
\'a0\'a0\'a0 Whilst marching from Portugal to a position which commands the\
approach to Madrid and the French forces, my officers have been\
diligently complying with your requests which have been sent by H.M. ship\
from London to Lisbon and thence by dispatch to our headquarters.\
\'a0\'a0\'a0 We have enumerated our saddles, bridles, tents and tent poles,\
and all manner of sundry items for which His Majesty's Government holds\
me accountable. I have dispatched reports on the character, wit, and\
spleen of every officer. Each item and every farthing has been accounted\
for, with two regrettable exceptions for which I beg your indulgence.\
\'a0\'a0\'a0 Unfortunately the sum of one shilling and ninepence remains\
unaccounted for in one infantry battalion's petty cash and there has been\
a hideous confusion as the the number of jars of raspberry jam issued to\
one cavalry regiment during a sandstorm in western Spain.\'a0 This\
reprehensible carelessness may be related to the pressure of circumstance,\
since we are war with France, a fact which may come as a bit of a surprise\
to you gentlemen in Whitehall.\
\'a0\'a0\'a0 This brings me to my present purpose, which is to request\
elucidation of my instructions from His Majesty's Government so that I\
may better understand why I am dragging an army over these barren plains.\
I construe that perforce it must be one of two alternative duties, as\
given below.\'a0 I shall pursue either one with the best of my ability, but\
I cannot do both:\
\'a0\'a0\'a0 1. To train an army of uniformed British clerks in Spain for the\
benefit of the accountants and copy-boys in London or perchance:\

Great Moments in History: #3\
August 27, 1949:\
\'a0\'a0\'a0 A Hall of Fame opened to honor outstanding members of the\
\'a0\'a0\'a0 Women's Air Corp.\'a0 It was a WAC's Museum.\
%\
\'a0\'a0\'a0 Grover Cleveland, though constantly at loggerheads with the\
Senate, got on better with the House of Representatives.\'a0 A popular\
story circulating during his presidency concerned the night he was\
roused by his wife crying, "Wake up!\'a0 I think there are burglars in the\
house."\
\'a0\'a0\'a0 "No, no, my dear," said the president sleepily, "in the Senate maybe,\
but not in the House."\
%\
Grub first, then ethics.\
\'a0\'a0\'a0 \'a0\'a0\'a0 -- Bertolt Brecht\
%\
Hark ye, Clinker, you are a most notorious offender.\'a0 You stand convicted of\
sickness, hunger, wretchedness, and want.\
\'a0\'a0\'a0 \'a0\'a0\'a0 -- Tobias Smollet\
%\
Has the great art and mystery of politics no apparent utility? Does it\
appear to be unqualifiedly ratty, raffish, sordid, obscene and low down,\
and its salient virtuosi a gang of umitigated scoundrels?\'a0 Then let us\
not forget its high capacity to soothe and tickel the midriff, its\
incomparable services as a maker of entertainment.\
\'a0\'a0\'a0 \'a0\'a0\'a0 -- H. L. Mencken, "A Carnival of Buncombe"\
%\
Have you noticed the way people's intelligence capabilities decline\
sharply the minute they start waving guns around?\
\'a0\'a0\'a0 \'a0\'a0\'a0 -- Dr. Who\
%\
He didn't run for reelection.\'a0 "Politics brings you into contact with all\
the people you'd give anything to avoid," he said. "I'm staying home."\
\'a0\'a0\'a0 \'a0\'a0\'a0 -- Garrison Keillor, "Lake Wobegone Days"\

He is the best of men who dislikes power.\

He that would govern others, first should be the master of himself.\

He who attacks the fundamentals of the American broadcasting industry\
attacks democracy itself.\

%\
He who slings mud generally loses ground.\
\'a0\'a0\'a0 \'a0\'a0\'a0 -- Adlai Stevenson\

\'a0\'a0\'a0 \'a0\'a0\'a0 -- Chief Joseph of the Nez Perce\
%\
Here comes the orator, with his flood of words and his drop of reason.\
%\
History has much to say on following the proper procedures.\'a0 From a history\
of the Mexican revolution:\
\'a0\'a0\'a0 "Hidalgo was later defeated at Guadalajara.\'a0 The rebel army was\
captured on its way through the mountains.\'a0 All were courtmartialed and\
shot, except Hidalgo, because he was a priest.\'a0 He was handed over to\
the bishop of Durango who excommunicated him and returned him to the\
army where he was then executed."\
%\
History is on our side (as long as we can control the historians).\
%\
History is the version of past events that people have decided to agree on.\
\'a0\'a0\'a0 \'a0\'a0\'a0 -- Napoleon Bonaparte, "Maxims"\
%\
History shows that the human mind, fed by constant accessions of knowledge,\
periodically grows too large for its theoretical coverings, and bursts them\
asunder to appear in new habiliments, as the feeding and growing grub, at\
intervals, casts its too narrow skin and assumes another...\'a0 Truly the imago\
state of Man seems to be terribly distant, but every moult is a step gained.\
\'a0\'a0\'a0 \'a0\'a0\'a0 -- Charles Darwin, from "Origin of the Species"\
%\
History teaches us that men and nations behave wisely once they have\
exhausted all other alternatives.\

%\
How can you govern a nation which has 246 kinds of cheese?\
\'a0\'a0\'a0 \'a0\'a0\'a0 -- Charles de Gaulle\
%\
How is the world ruled, and how do wars start?\'a0 Diplomats tell lies to\
journalists, and they believe what they read.\
\'a0\'a0\'a0 \'a0\'a0\'a0 -- Karl Kraus, "Aphorisms and More Aphorisms"\
%\
I am a friend of the working man, and I would rather be his friend\
than be one.\
\'a0\'a0\'a0 \'a0\'a0\'a0 -- Clarence Darrow\
%\
I am convinced that the truest act of courage is to sacrifice ourselves\
for others in a totally nonviolent struggle for justice.\'a0 To be a man\
is to suffer for others.\
\'a0\'a0\'a0 \'a0\'a0\'a0 -- Cesar Chavez\
%\
I am not a politician and my other habits are also good.\
\'a0\'a0\'a0 \'a0\'a0\'a0 -- A. Ward\
%\
I can hire one half of the working class to kill the other half.\
\'a0\'a0\'a0 \'a0\'a0\'a0 -- Jay Gould\

\'a0\'a0\'a0 \'a0\'a0\'a0 \'a0\'a0 with Dutch Schultz.\
I don't trust Legs.\'a0 He's nuts.\'a0 He gets excited and starts pulling a\

the sons of former slaves and the sons of former slaveowners will be able to\

I have already given two cousins to the war and I stand ready to sacrifice\
my wife's brother.\

I have always noticed that whenever a radical takes to Imperialism,\
he catches it in a very acute form.\
\'a0\'a0\'a0 \'a0\'a0\'a0 -- Winston Churchill, 1903\
%\
I have discovered the art of deceiving diplomats. I tell them the truth\
and they never believe me.\
\'a0\'a0\'a0 \'a0\'a0\'a0 -- Camillo Di Cavour\
%\
I have gained this by philosophy:\
that I do without being commanded what others do only from fear of the law.\
\'a0\'a0\'a0 \'a0\'a0\'a0 -- Aristotle\
%\
I have never understood this liking for war.\'a0 It panders to instincts\
already catered for within the scope of any respectable domestic establishment.\
\'a0\'a0\'a0 \'a0\'a0\'a0 -- Alan Bennett\
%\
I hold it, that a little rebellion, now and then, is a good thing...\

I know not with what weapons World War III will be fought, but World\
War IV will be fought with sticks and stones.\
\'a0\'a0\'a0 \'a0\'a0\'a0 -- Albert Einstein\
%\
I like to believe that people in the long run are going to do more to promote\
peace than our governments.\'a0 Indeed, I think that people want peace so much\
that one of these days governments had better get out of the way and let them\
have it.\
\'a0\'a0\'a0 \'a0\'a0\'a0 -- Dwight D. Eisenhower\
%\
I might have gone to West Point, but I was too proud to speak to a congressman.\
\'a0\'a0\'a0 \'a0\'a0\'a0 -- Will Rogers\
%\
I needed the good will of the legislature of four states.\'a0 I formed the\
legislative bodies with my own money.\'a0 I found that it was cheaper that way.\

I never deny, I never contradict.\'a0 I sometimes forget.\

I never vote for anyone.\'a0 I always vote against.\
\'a0\'a0\'a0 \'a0\'a0\'a0 -- W. C. Fields\
%\
I owe the government $3400 in taxes.\'a0 So I sent them two hammers and a\
toilet seat.\
\'a0\'a0\'a0 \'a0\'a0\'a0 -- Michael McShane\
%\
I place economy among the first and most important virtues, and public debt as\
the greatest of dangers to be feared.\'a0 To preserve our independence, we must\
not let our rulers load us with perpetual debt.\'a0 If we run into such debts, we\
must be taxed in our meat and drink, in our necessities and in our comforts,\
in our labor and in our amusements.\'a0 If we can prevent the government from\
wasting the labor of the people, under the pretense of caring for them, they\
will be happy.\
\'a0\'a0\'a0 \'a0\'a0\'a0 -- Thomas Jefferson\
%\
I pledge allegiance to the flag\

one nation,\
indivisible,\

%\
I prefer the most unjust peace to the most righteous war.\
\'a0\'a0\'a0 \'a0\'a0\'a0 -- Cicero\
Even peace may be purchased at too high a price.\
\'a0\'a0\'a0 \'a0\'a0\'a0 -- Poor Richard\
%\
I realize that the MX missile is none of our concern.\'a0 I realize that the\
whole point of living in a democracy is that we pay professional\
congresspersons to concern themselves with things like the MX missile so we\
can be free to concern ourselves with getting hold of the plumber.\
But from time to time, I feel I must address major public issues such as\
this, because in a free and open society, where the very future of the world\
hinges on decisions made by our elected leaders, you never win large cash\
journalism awards if you stick to the topics I usually write about, such as\
nose-picking.\
\'a0\'a0\'a0 \'a0\'a0\'a0 -- Dave Barry, "At Last, the Ultimate Deterrent Against\
\'a0\'a0\'a0 \'a0\'a0\'a0 \'a0\'a0 Political Fallout"\

I see a good deal of talk from Washington about lowering taxes.\'a0 I hope\
they do get 'em lowered down enough so people can afford to pay 'em.\
\'a0\'a0\'a0 \'a0\'a0\'a0 -- The Best of Will Rogers\
%\
I see where we are starting to pay some attention to our neigbors to\
the south.\'a0 We could never understand why Mexico wasn't just crazy about\
us; for we have always had their good will, and oil and minerals, at heart.\

I try not to break the rules but merely to test their elasticity.\
\'a0\'a0\'a0 \'a0\'a0\'a0 -- Bill Veeck\
%\
I try to keep an open mind, but not so open that my brains fall out.\
\'a0\'a0\'a0 \'a0\'a0\'a0 -- Judge Harold T. Stone\
%\
I use not only all the brains I have, but all those I can borrow as well.\
\'a0\'a0\'a0 \'a0\'a0\'a0 -- Woodrow Wilson\
%\
I used to be a rebel in my youth.\
This cause... that cause... (chuckle) I backed 'em ALL!\'a0 But I learned.\
Rebellion is simply a device used by the immature to hide from his own\
problems.\'a0 So I lost interest in politics.\'a0 Now when I feel aroused by\
a civil rights case or a passport hearing... I realize it's just a device.\
I go to my analyst and we work it out.\'a0 You have no idea how much better\
I feel these days.\
\'a0\'a0\'a0 \'a0\'a0\'a0 -- J. Feiffer\
%\
I want to be the white man's brother, not his brother-in-law.\
\'a0\'a0\'a0 \'a0\'a0\'a0 -- Martin Luther King, Jr.\
%\
I was appalled by this story of the destruction of a member of a valued\
endangered species.\'a0 It's all very well to celebrate the practicality of\
pigs by ennobling the porcine sibling who constructed his home out of\
bricks and mortar.\'a0 But to wantonly destroy a wolf, even one with an\
excessive taste for porkers, is unconscionable in these ecologically\
critical times when both man and his domestic beasts continue to maraud\
the earth.\
\'a0\'a0\'a0 \'a0\'a0\'a0 Sylvia Kamerman, "Book Reviewing"\
%\
I was offered a job as a hoodlum and I turned it down cold.\'a0 A thief is\
anybody who gets out and works for his living, like robbing a bank or\
breaking into a place and stealing stuff, or kidnapping somebody.\'a0 He really\
gives some effort to it.\'a0 A hoodlum is a pretty lousy sort of scum.\'a0 He\
works for gangsters and bumps guys off when they have been put on the spot.\
Why, after I'd made my rep, some of the Chicago Syndicate wanted me to work\
for them as a hood -- you know, handling a machine gun.\'a0 They offered me\
two hundred and fifty dollars a week and all the protection I needed.\'a0 I\
was on the lam at the time and not able to work at my regular line.\'a0 But\
I wouldn't consider it.\'a0 "I'm a thief," I said.\'a0 "I'm no lousy hoodlum."\

I went to my mother and told her I intended to commence a different life.\'a0 I\

I wish a robot would get elected president.\'a0 That way, when he came to town,\
we could all take a shot at him and not feel too bad.\

I would like the government to do all it can to mitigate, then, in\

our tasks will be solved.\

I would like to electrocute everyone who uses the word 'fair' in connection\

Bay, then up the Golden Gate or down 101 to Los Altos or La Honda...\'a0 You could\
strike sparks anywhere. There was a fantastic universal sense that whatever we\
were doing was right, that we were winning...\
\'a0\'a0\'a0 And that, I think, was the handle -- that sense of inevitable victory\
over the forces of Old and Evil.\'a0 Not in any mean or military sense; we didn't\
need that. Our energy would simply prevail.\'a0 There was no point in fighting\
-- on our side or theirs.\'a0 We had all the momentum; we were riding the crest\
of a high and beautiful wave.\'a0 So now, less than five years later, you can go\

The Least Successful Executions\

Scotland at Rothesay, when they got stuck in the revolving doors.\'a0 They\
had to be helped free by the staff and, after thanking everyone,\
sheepishly left the building.\

The Worst Prison Guards\
\'a0\'a0\'a0 The largest number of convicts ever to escape simultaneously from a\
maximum security prison is 124.\'a0 This record is held by Alcoente Prison,\
near Lisbon in Portugal.\
\'a0\'a0\'a0 During the weeks leading up to the escape in July 1978 the prison\
warders had noticed that attendances had fallen at film shows which\
included "The Great Escape", and also that 220 knives and a huge quantity\
of electric cable had disappeared.\'a0 A guard explained, "Yes, we were\
planning to look for them, but never got around to it."\'a0 The warders had\
not, however, noticed the gaping holes in the wall because they were\
"covered with posters".\'a0 Nor did they detect any of the spades, chisels,\
water hoses and electric drills amassed by the inmates in large quantities.\
The night before the breakout one guard had noticed that of the 36\
prisoners in his block only 13 were present.\'a0 He said this was "normal"\
because inmates sometimes missed roll-call or hid, but usually came back\
the next morning.\
\'a0\'a0\'a0 "We only found out about the escape at 6:30 the next morning when\
one of the prisoners told us," a warder said later.\'a0 [...]\'a0 When they\
eventually checked, the prison guards found that exactly half of the gaol's\
population was missing.\'a0 By way of explanation the Justice Minister, Dr.\
Santos Pais, claimed that the escape was "normal" and part of the\
"legitimate desire of the prisoner to regain his liberty."\

the national attention upon the direction to proceed.\'a0 Finally, an articulate\
and wise leader must sense these first three conditions and put forth with\
words and action the great thing to be accomplished.\'a0 The motivation of young\
Americans to do what needs to be done flows from such a coincidence of\
conditions. ...\'a0 The Thomas Jeffersons, The Teddy Roosevelts, The John\
Kennedys appear.\'a0 We must begin to create the tools of leadership which they,\
and their young frontiersmen, will require to lead us onward and upward.\

What is status?\
\'a0\'a0\'a0 Status is when the President calls you for your opinion.\
Uh, no...\
\'a0\'a0\'a0 Status is when the President calls you in to discuss a\
\'a0\'a0\'a0 problem with him.\
Uh, that still ain't right...\
\'a0\'a0\'a0 STATUS is when you're in the Oval Office talking to the President,\
\'a0\'a0\'a0 and the phone rings.\'a0 The President picks it up, listens for a\
\'a0\'a0\'a0 minute, and hands it to you, saying, "It's for you."\

When we jumped into Sicily, the units became separated, and I couldn't find\
anyone.\'a0 Eventually I stumbled across two colonels, a major, three captains,\
two lieutenants, and one rifleman, and we secured the bridge.\'a0 Never in the\

You first have to decide whether to use the short or the long form. The\
short form is what the Internal Revenue Service calls "simplified", which\
means it is designed for people who need the help of a Sears tax-preparation\
expert to distinguish between their first and last names.\'a0 Here's the\
complete text:\
"(1) How much did you make?\'a0 (AMOUNT)\
(2) How much did we here at the government take out?\'a0 (AMOUNT)\
(3) Hey!\'a0 Sounds like we took too much!\'a0 So we're going to\
\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0 send an official government check for (ONE-FIFTEENTH OF\
\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0 THE AMOUNT WE TOOK) directly to the (YOUR LAST NAME)\
\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0 household at (YOUR ADDRESS), for you to spend in any way\
\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0 you please! Which just goes to show you, (YOUR FIRST\
\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0 NAME), that it pays to file the short form!"\
The IRS wants you to use this form because it gets to keep most of your\
money.\'a0 So unless you have pond silt for brains, you want the long form.\

You must include all income you receive in the form of money, property\
and services if it is not specifically exempt.\'a0 Report property (goods)\
and services at their fair market values.\'a0 Examples include income from\
bartering or swapping transactions, side commissions, kickbacks, rent\
paid in services, illegal activities (such as stealing, drugs, etc.),\
cash skimming by proprietors and tradesmen, "moonlighting" services,\
gambling, prizes and awards.\'a0 Not reporting such income can lead to\
prosecution for perjury and fraud.\

Is uniformity attainable?\'a0 Millions of innocent men, women, and\

The human instinct to censor thrives, as it always will, living in\
irrepressible conflict with the human instinct to speak.\'a0 Outrage,\
self-righteousness, and paranoia feed the maw of censorship.\
Squelching speech, however, never reduces society's net paranoia\
quotient; it simply redirects it, drives it underground, where it\
festers into more dangerous hysterias.\'a0 In the words of Justice\
Brandeis, "Men feared witches and burned women."\

Cautious, careful people always casting about to preserve their\
reputation or social standards never can bring about reform.\'a0 Those\
who are totally in earnest are willing to be anything or nothing in\

out, avow their sympathies with despised ideas and their advocates,\
and bear the consequences.\

"Even if you want no state, or a minimal state, then you still have to\
